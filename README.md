# RDA DMP Common Standard
Our implementation of the RDA DMP Common Standard for machine-actionable Data
Management Plans.

The [Research Data Alliance][rda] is an international initiative to enable open
sharing of data. The [RDA's DMP Command Standard][rda-dmp-common-standard] is
the RDA's specification designed to provide interoperability between system
consuming and producing machine-actionable Data Management Plans (maDMP). This
repository is an implementation of the specification in Java so that the
various services that we integrate with can be implemented with a common set of
classes.
